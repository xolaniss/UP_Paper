The extension of affordable credit is key to financial inclusion, but it could lower financial sector stability. Macroprudential policy on the other hand, is designed to mitigate financial sector risk. Thus, it is possible inclusion and macroprudential regulations may oppose one another. This study estimates and contrasts the impact of these potentially contradictory regulations on the bank lending rates and volumes of South Africa's largest banks. Our results suggest that macroprudential policy is working as intended as it is associated with increases in interest rates on unsecured lending rates, decreases in short-term secured and mortgage lending rates.  Inclusion focused regulation is associated with increased bank lending rates in unsecured credit. We observe a decrease in the growth of unsecured lending for households and an increase in secured lending for corporates. As opposed to offsetting regulations, we find that the estimated impacts of financial inclusion initiatives largely overlap with those estimated for macroprudential policy.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The extension of affordable credit is one key component to financial
inclusion.\footnote{Financial inclusion is a multi-faceted concept that
  relates to access by individuals and businesses to affordable
  transaction, payments, savings, credit and insurance products
  \citep{WBGweb}. This paper focuses on the aspect of inclusion related
  to the greater usage of affordable credit}. Owing to South Africa's
Apartheid history, levels of financial inclusion were significant low at
the dawn of democracy \citep{hawkins2004}. Increasing financial
inclusion levels has thus been a government imperative post-1994, and
has been pursued through financial sector regulatory reforms. However,
research indicates that greater financial inclusion, achieved through
credit extension, may lower financial stability \citep{garcia2016}.
Conversely, macroprudential policies are necessarily pursued in order to
achieve stability in the finance sector and consists of policies that
could increase bank capital requirements that ultimately lower lending
in order to meet said requirements. Therefore inclusion and
macroprudential policies have different objectives that could offset one
another.

In this paper we first estimate the realised impacts of separate
regulatory developments related to macroprudential policy and financial
inclusion to determine if these initiatives meet their intended goals.
Second, we consider whether the two regulatory approaches are
potentially contradictory. We achieve this through a panel data approach
to estimate the impact of different regulatory developments on bank
rates and three month changes in bank lending volumes.

To measure regulatory developments, we develop narrative indices that
comprehensively measure all developments relevant to our study. This
approach is consistent with various studies that consider the effect of
macroprudential reforms on the stock of lending
(\citep{eickmeier2018macroeconomic}; \citep{richter2019costs};
\citep{budnik2020identifying}; \citep{rojas2022macroeconomic};
\citep{fernandez2023transmission}). However, this paper extends this
type of analysis by also considering the impact of financial regulations
geared towards inclusion. We also compile a dataset comprising public
and confidential bank data related to the four largest banks in South
Africa. This allows us to analyse how the largest banks in South Africa
respond to the two potentially opposing regulations.

Our analysis differs from existing literature in the following respects.
First, we consider the impact of regulatory developments on both lending
volumes and bank pricing. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is
the first in South Africa to consider the impact of bank regulation on
bank pricing. Second, we measure bank responses in disaggregated
customer segments, as opposed to assess changes in aggregate lending.
This approach allows us to measure whether bank responses differ in
different customers segments. Third, our analysis considers separate
models for each of the narrative indices. This allows us to estimate
heterogeneity in bank responses in the face of different regulations.
Our approach provides us with the ability to infer whether these two
regulatory approaches are consistent with their own objectives, but also
with each other.

Our results indicate that macroprudential policy is working as intended
to achieve financial sector stability. We find that macroprudential
regulation results in increases in interest rates in unsecured lending
and decreases in secured lending and mortgage rates. Macroprudential
regulations are also associated with positive growth in lending volumes
in unsecured and secured credit while mortgage lending growth rates
decrease. We estimate that inclusion focused initiatives result in
increased bank lending rates for unsecured credit to households and
decreased growth in the unsecured lending volumes to households. We also
observe increases in the growth of secured lending to corporates and a
decrease in secured lending rates paid by those corporates. As opposed
to these two regulatory approaches offsetting one another, we find that
the estimated impacts of financial inclusion initiatives largely overlap
with those estimated for macroprudential policy. This is likely because
inclusion focused regulation may be at odds with its own stated
objectives.

The paper is structured as follows. First, we provide a comprehensive
review of literature indicating how banks have responded to
macroprudential and finance regulation intended for inclusion. Second,
we describe the construction of our narrative indices. Third, we
describe our data and methodology. Fourth, we discuss our results and
thereafter conclude.

\section{Literature Review}\label{literature-review}

Our paper encompasses and contributes to various strands of the
literature. It encompasses literature on the response of banks to
macroprudential reforms and the response of banks to efforts aimed at
enabling financial inclusion. The construction of narrative indices on
macroprudential and financial inclusion reforms relate to literature on
narrative methods of identification.

\subsection{Macroprudential regulatory
developments}\label{macroprudential-regulatory-developments}

The objective(s) of macroprudential reforms are well documented and
continue to expand with further reforms being introduced to create
resilient banking
systems\footnote{See \cite{kashyap2004cyclical}, \cite{basel06}, \cite{cohen2016banks} and \cite{cerutti2018changes}, among others.}.
The ongoing debate regarding the implications of the reforms,
particularly on bank lending behaviour of banks provides further insight
on the costs and benefits of reforms, meant to make banking systems more
resilient.

Work on the costs or unintended consequences of macroprudential reforms
dominate the debate. \cite{noss2016estimating} highlight that tightened
macroprudential capital requirements can cause banks' cost of funding to
rise and, in turn, prompt banks to pass the increases in their costs of
funding to borrowers in the form of high interest on loans and/or
reductions in credit extended. \cite{deli2017real} show that higher
capital requirements would lead banks to reduce their risk-weighted
assets, implying a downward shift in lending in order to meet the
capital requirements. \cite{noss2016estimating} use a Vector
Autoregressive (VAR) model to estimate the effect of changes in banks'
capital requirements on lending in the United Kingdom (UK) and find that
tighter capital requirements are associated with a reduction in lending,
with the effect on corporate lending more pronounced relative to
household lending.

Earlier work by \cite{aiyar2016does} studies the interaction of capital
requirements and monetary policy along with the UK banks responses to
the two policies. They find that banks reduce lending in response to
tighter capital reforms and monetary policy. They also exploit the
heterogeneity of banks, finding that large banks react to tighter
capital requirements only, while small banks react to both policies.
\cite{deli2017real} and \cite{mirzaei2022effectiveness} provide
cross-country evidence on the effect of macroprudential reforms. The
former authors analyse banks in 125 countries finding weak negative
effects of capital stringency on loan growth, especially for
well-capitalized banks. \cite{mirzaei2022effectiveness} find similar
results for banks in 91 countries, where small, less-capitalized and
less-liquid banks reduce lending more in response to stringent capital
requirements, relative to banks that are well-capitalized and
highly-liquid. \cite{angelini2015b} studies the impact that capital
requirements have on national output using various Dynamic Stochastic
General Equilibrium (DSGE) models. \cite{angelini2015b} find that a one
percentage point increase in the capital ratio translates into a 0.09
percent loss in output, relative to the level that would have prevailed
in the absence of capital tightening.

Work on the potential effect of macroprudential reforms in emerging
markets is limited. The exception is recent work by \cite{fang2022bank}
who study the impact of rising capital requirements on lending in Peru.
They exploit bank-level lending data and bank-specific capital buffers.
Their findings show that higher capital requirements are associated with
lower credit extension. The effects, however, vary according to economic
conditions and bank characteristics, where less capitalized, less liquid
and less profitable banks react more to tighter capital requirements.
The effects are also more pronounced during economic downturns. In the
case of South Africa, earlier work by \cite{maredza2016capital}
investigates the impact of increased bank requirements and, in
particular, those introduced under Basel II on the cost of
intermediation. Results from a panel of ten banks show that tighter
capital requirements increase the cost of intermediation, with the net
interest margin serving as a proxy for the cost of intermediation.
\cite{gumata2017bank} assess the impact of Basel III in the form of
liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratios on credit growth.
Their decomposition exercise shows that Basel III contributed to the
contraction in credit after the global financial crisis. Most recently
and similar to our work, \cite{sibande2024} study the impact of Basel
III capital requirements on the supply of bank credit in South Africa
using data from the big four banks. Their findings indicate weaker
evidence of the impact of capital requirements on the supply of bank
lending. \cite{makrelov2024lending} study how decisions around the size
of excess capital as well as monetary and financial stability actions
impact sectoral lending in South Africa. Using data on big and small
banks, their findings indicate that holding additional capital affect,
their lending, especially for small banks.

This paper contributes to the work analysing the impact of Basel related
regulations in emerging countries and in particular, South Africa, by
constructing a narrative account of macroprudential policies. This
provides a historical documentation of major developments in
macroprudential regulation. The paper further contributes by analyzing
the impact of the policies on bank lending rates, as existing work
largely focus on bank lending volumes.

\subsection{Financial inclusion regulatory
developments}\label{financial-inclusion-regulatory-developments}

Financial inclusion has been identified as key to development. Greater
access to credit, savings accounts and transactional services have
enabled individuals to store money safely, make and receive payments and
invest for the future \citep{demirgucc2021}. Empirical studies have also
shown that greater levels of financial inclusion are associated with
lower levels of poverty. \citet{mahalika2023} estimate such a
relationship for South Africa through the regression of poverty levels
on a derived measure of financial exclusion. On a macro-level, there are
studies, albeit limited, linking financial inclusion with greater
economic growth, employment and lower inequality \citep{demirgucc2017}.
The importance of financial inclusion is also highlighted by its
recognition as a strategy that could be used to achieve the United
Nation's sustainable development goals \citep{ozili2021}.\footnote{More
  specifically, \citet{yap2023} conduct a cross-country analysis
  examining the relationship between 7 sustainable development goals
  (SDGs) and financial inclusion. They find statistical evidence
  indicating that greater financial inclusion is associated with SDGs 2
  (ending hunger), 5 (reducing gender inequality) and 8 (promoting
  economic growth).}

The creation of, or the changes in, financial regulation has been used
as a tool to further financial inclusion in various jurisdictions to
different levels of success. \citet{chen2019} indicate that close to 2
of 3 national regulatory and supervisory entities in the world further
financial inclusion by, inter alia, easing entry by increasing consumer
protection and financial literacy, as well as supporting the creation of
non-traditional financial service providers. They further state that a
supportive regulatory environment enables the growth of service
providers and the provision of products that meet the needs of various
customers thus furthering financial inclusion. There is a wide array of
regulatory changes that governments have pursued to further inclusion.
Our study is focused on greater access and usage to affordable credit
products. Therefore, relevant financial sector regulatory efforts
include the creation of inclusive financial institutes, credit
databases, newly designed financial products, the promotion of
technology as a method to deliver financial products, lending
regulations, and the provision of subsidised funding
\citep{yoshino2016}. Consumer protection measures are also touted as
necessary to support financial inclusion \citep{yoshino2016}. A number
of these developments overlap with inclusion related developments,
initiated by South African authorities, that we consider in our study. A
review of empirical analyses of these types of regulatory developments
and their impact on credit extension, are discussed further below.

Regulations that result in credit databases that include relevant credit
related information on individuals and firms reduce the level of
asymmetry that exists between lenders and borrowers. Banking markets are
characterised by informational asymmetries, where a lender may not know
the credit worthiness of a potential borrower. In such instances, banks
may choose to credit ration \citep{stiglitz1981}. This imbalance in
information may also have an impact on market entry in credit markets.
\citet{dell1999} show that when a potential entrant bank is unable to
differentiate good from bad borrowers, entry is likely to be deterred.
\citet{dell2001} suggests that this barrier to entry can be lessened,
when banks are able to gain proprietary information about borrowers over
time. However, gaining such information provides banks with market power
over clients, where older creditworthy clients are charged higher
rates.\footnote{\citet{dell2001} indicates that this result is a
  function of their two period model. They indicate that over extended
  periods creditworthy customers may seek to switch credit providers
  thus attracting lower interest rates. However, we note that a lower
  proclivity to switching may affect this prediction.}
\citet{martinez2014} estimate the impact of credit information sharing
systems on bank lending to firms. The credit information schemes they
consider include credit bureaus and public credit registries that
capture information on borrowers, thus decreasing the informational
asymmetry that characterise credit markets. \citet{martinez2014} find
that following the introduction of a credit bureau, firms had increased
access to finance, lower interest rates, longer maturity terms and
increased working capital.

Consumer protection mechanisms are also pursued by various national
authorities to further financial inclusion. These are usefully
summarised by \citet{yoshino2016} as the creation of rgulatory agencies
that regulate credit extension. They explain further that consumer
protection initiatives implemented by these agencies include the
provision of guidelines to be followed when conducting affordability
assessments and providing consumers with information on legal recourse
following fraud. \citet{yoshino2016} indicate that consumer protection
could further financial inclusion as they increase consumer trust in
financial services, supporting usage. \citet{chen2019} estimate that
inclusion focused regulatory measures impact financial inclusion. Their
index of regulatory measures captures many regulations, as well as
consumer protection initiatives that support interest rate disclosures
to customers.

In South Africa, the National Credit Act (``NCA'' hereafter) of 2006
resulted in a host of changes in credit market regulation that included
provisions increasing disclosures on the costs of credit, to protect
credit customers from reckless lending, the regulation of interest rates
and the creation of national credit institutions, such as the National
Credit Regulator \citep{groen2006}. \citet{chipeta2012} study the impact
of the announcement and actual implementation of the NCA on the growth
of credit extension in South Africa. Using regression analysis, these
authors find that the NCA was associated with greater loan growth in
credit card, overdrafts and other conventional loans, as well as total
credit to the private sector. The finding arises from both the
announcement and the implementation of the Act. \citet{dewet2015} assess
the impact of the NCA on levels of over-indebtedness. They do not find
evidence of impact on the levels of over-indebtedness in South Africa.
\citet{makhanya2016} provide a qualitative analysis of Capitec's entry
into the banking industry. According to their analysis, the NCA provided
certainty in unsecured lending that enabled Capitec to provide larger
loan amounts over extended periods of time. This development is
significant as Capitec's growth in the banking industry is underpinned
by its growth in the low-income market \citep{makhanya2016}.

Other initiatives, such as interest rate caps applied to bank lending
volumes have also been implemented by regulatory authorities to support
financial inclusion. \citet{yoshino2016} indicate that these interest
rate caps are applied in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Thailand.
Presumably, interest rate caps support inclusion by artificially
lowering the cost of lending for customers, who would have been charged
interest rates above the specified caps. However, this type of
regulation can have an adverse effect on inclusion through the
restriction of credit supply \citep{yoshino2016}. Such restrictions
would reverse the proposed gains in inclusion. \citet{barua2016}
indicate that enabling banks to price risk without constraints is likely
to support financial inclusion in the long term.

Following the development of the NCA, there have been a number of
changes in the regulations accompanying the NCA. Whilst there is limited
research on the impact of the NCA on bank lending, none of the
subsequent changes in the NCA have been subject to empirical study.
South Africa's national inclusion framework also includes fundamental
changes in financial sector regulations with a clear intent to increase
inclusion. Furthermore, the country's financial ministry has developed a
draft national policy framework specific to increasing financial
inclusion for individuals and firms. No empirical research has assessed
the impact of this suite of financial inclusion focused regulatory
developments on inclusion outcomes in South Africa.

\subsection{Methods of identification}\label{methods-of-identification}

Lastly, we follow narrative methods of identification. As outlined
earlier, evidence on the response of bank lending to macroprudential
reforms is based on the assumption that an increase in aggregate
regulatory capital represents a negative credit supply shock and in turn
have a negative effect on credit extension \citep{noss2016estimating}.
As such, our narrative accounts of macroprudential reforms implicitly
proxy for credit supply shocks. \cite{ramey2016macroeconomic} describes
the narrative method of identification as constructing a time series
from historical documents to identify the reason and/or the quantities
associated with a particular change in a variable. Furthermore, the
construction of narrative accounts is particularly aimed at exclusively
isolating shocks or effects of policy intervention
\citep{angelopoulou2007narrative}. Therefore, by constructing a
narrative series of macroprudential reforms, we aim to address
challenges relating to the identification of macroprudential reforms and
their impact thereof.

The application of the identification strategy has largely focused on
identifying monetary and fiscal
shocks\footnote{For instance, \cite{romer1989does}; \cite{romer1997identification}; \cite{romer2004new} use the approach to identify new measures of monetary policy shocks. \cite{romer2010macroeconomic}; \cite{ramey2011identifying}; \cite{ramey2018government} use the approach to identify fiscal or tax shocks.}.
However, the approach is increasingly being applied to analyse and
identify capital reforms. For instance, \cite{budnik2020identifying}
analyse the dynamic effects of U.S macroprudential policies by
constructing a set of policy measures related to capital requirements
following the Basel III Accords. The narrative instruments take a value
of -1 and 1 in the case of tightening and easing of capital
requirements, respectively and 0 otherwise. Importantly, results from
their analysis show that tightening of capital requirements induces a
persistent decline in corporate credit. Further, the impact of a change
in capital requirements is concentrated more on corporate credit
relative to household credit. \cite{eickmeier2018macroeconomic} also
assess the dynamic effects of bank capital regulation in the U.S, where
they use the narrative approach to construct an exogenous capital
regulation index that captures exogenous changes in bank capital
regulation. Their results also show persistent declines in corporate and
investment loans and real estate loans, following changes in the capital
regulation index. Recent work by \cite{richter2019costs},
\cite{rojas2022macroeconomic} and \cite{fernandez2023transmission} use
the approach to identify and uncover effects of specific or individual
policies under Basel macroprudential regulations.

We therefore add to the growing empirical literature examining the
response of banks to regulatory reforms applying narrative methods of
identification. We consider the entirety of Basel related
macroprudential regulations and not individual or specific regulations,
which allows us to have robust documentation of macroprudential reforms.
As outlined earlier, existing work analyses the effect of both easing
and tightening of macroprudential regulations. In the construction of
our narrative series, however, we do not find evidence of regulatory
easing. We therefore capture only the tightening of macroprudential
regulations.

\section{Narrative Indicators}\label{narrative-indicators}

\subsection{Macroprudential reforms}\label{macroprudential-reforms}

This section presents actions and events we use to construct a set of
macroprudential measures or indicators introduced following Basel II
Agreements and Accords. The indicators represent credit supply shocks,
following \cite{noss2016estimating} and \cite{deli2017real}, among
others. The construction is based on historical documents containing
actions and events that lead to the implementation of macroprudential
regulations. Our analysis covers 2008 to 2019 due to data limitations.
We consult circulars issued by the SARB to commercial banks in South
Africa, annual reports of commercial banks and SARB and risk and capital
management reports of commercial banks. We consider reports from only
the big 4 commercial banks in South Africa, as they account for over 90
percent of banking industry
assets.\footnote{The big 4 banks are Standard Bank, ABSA, Nedbank and First Rand.}
We also consider documents published and issued by the Basel Committee
on Bank Supervision (BCBS), containing communication between BCBS and
SARB relating to the implementation of Basel regulations.\footnote{It is
  important to note that the policy indicators capturing macroprudential
  reforms are not-bank specific. For instance, banks in our panel may,
  at their discretion, increase their capital buffers in addition to
  minimum requirements. However, the minimum macroprudential
  (predominantly capital requirements) reforms are applied uniformly
  across banks.}

Due to the wide variety of information contained in the documents, we
impose a criteria with which we use to identify actions and events that
are most important in the construction of our narrative indicators. For
the set of macroprudential indicators proxy for credit shocks, the
criteria imposed is such that: (1) actions and events are specific in
their intentions and (2), actions and events might imply a change in
bank behaviour with respect to the adjustment of capital buffers and/or
the attachment of greater risk weights to certain lending products or
lending markets. From this, we are able to build a series of two
narrative indicators \(z_{t}\) defined such that \(z_{t}=1\) for dates
of events containing announcements and communications on regulations
intended to be passed and the drafting of such regulation which we call
\(Draft\). The second indicator is such that \(z_{t}=1\) for dates of
events recording the eventual implementation of the regulation, which we
call \(Implementation\). For dates where \(Draft\) and
\(Implementation\) is not observed, \(z_{t}=0\). Therefore, where
possible, we also track the actions and events from the date they are
communicated and or announced, issued or published (\(Draft\)), until
the date they are introduced or implemented (\(Implementation\)).

The decomposition of the actions and events is done with the aim of
possibly identifying anticipation effects following the drafting of
regulation not yet implemented. For instance,
\cite{eickmeier2018macroeconomic} analyse the macroeconomic effects of
bank capital requirement tightenings using a narrative index of bank
regulatory capital in the U.S. They find that bank assets (loans) and
industrial production fall 6 months before new rules become effective.
The anticipation effects are captured by the banks' actions between
dates when regulation is first mentioned in proposed rules and dates
when the final rule is communicated. In effect, anticipation effects are
therefore based on the notion that banks have information on the
proposed regulation and dates which they will be implemented and, as
such, they can act (expand credit for instance) before implementation
and thereby take advantage of less stringent requirements on credit
extension before tighter requirements are introduced. Information
contained in the documents we use to construct our narrative indicators
also contain details enabling us to exploit such anticipation effects.

Importantly, we do not identify the impact of individual regulations and
requirements under Basel Accords and Agreements; rather, we consider
Basel regulations in their entirety. For instance, different Basel
regulations, such as the capital and liquidity requirements, target
different instruments. However, the entirety of Basel regulations, which
both capital and liquidity requirements fall under, is aimed at creating
resilient and robust banking systems, through higher bank capital
requirements \citep{cohen2016banks} \citep{cerutti2018changes}.

As an example, the implementation of Basel II on January 1, 2008 is
categorized as an implementation indicator. On February 4, 2009, which
we categorize as a \(Draft\) indicator, the SARB issues directive 1/2009
(1 of 2009) announcing the approach banks should follow in the
application of capital floors. ``Modelled capital should not be below
80\% of the capital requirements under Basel I to ensure capital levels
do not fall below prudent level''.

Following Basel II, banks are allowed to use internal models to
determine risk weights and in turn, determine capital levels. However,
capital floors ensure capital requirements did not fall below a certain
percentage of banks' capital requirements under the previous Basel I
framework \citep{basel06}. This, in essence, implies greater risk weight
attached to riskier credit products. For instance,
\cite{imbierowicz2018time} show that Danish banks reduce their lending
on loans with higher risk weights in response to higher capital
requirements, including approaches to capital floors. A further example
which is categorized as a \(Draft\) indicator and tracked until
implementation, occurs on July 31, 2009, where the BCBS announces
``measures to strengthen the 1996 rules governing trading book capital
and to enhance the three pillars of the Basel II framework (Basel
2.5)''. This in essence, aims to introduce higher capital requirements
to capture the credit risk of complex trading activities, promote the
build-up of capital buffers that can be drawn down in periods of stress
and strengthen the quality of bank capital \citep{basel09}. The SARB
endorsed and gave notices to banks to prepare for the implementation on
October 8, 2010, following the communication by the BCBS on July 31,
2009. Following both communications and announcements, Basel 2.5 is
eventually implemented January 1, 2012. A detailed account and timeline
of the indicators are in Appendix A.6.

\subsection{Finance regulation
reforms}\label{finance-regulation-reforms}

The finance regulations that we consider in this paper are regulations
that relate to the implementation of the NCA of 2005, the wholesale
restructuring. of financial sector regulation in South Africa, as well
as the drafting of a national framework for financial inclusion. These
developments have been selected as they relate to a series of regulatory
reforms that have the intention of increasing financial inclusion in
South Africa. We refer to a concept of financial inclusion that is
consistent with \citet{WBGweb}. According to this definition, financial
inclusion occurs when there is access to useful and affordable financial
products, although we specifically focuse on credit products. Therefore,
we review and capture regulatory developments that have the intention of
facilitating greater access to credit products and/or reducing the cost
of said products. These regulatory developments are summarised in the
variable: \(FinReg\). This variable is recorded as 1, following the
presentation of draft or final finance regulations made publicly
available; it is \(FinReg=0\), otherwise. Below we provide an overview
of the type of regulatory developments we capture within \(FinReg\). A
detailed review of each of these regulations is provided in Appendix
A.8.

The first type of development we consider are those related to the
national credit regulations. These are regulations issued by the
\citet{regulations2006} and relate to the application of the NCA of
2005. Over time the Department of Trade and Industry has provided
government notices inviting public comments on potential amendments to
these regulations and, following consultation, final regulations were
published in the Government Gazette. The Ministry has put forth notices
and final regulations related to (i) Debt Counselling Regulations in
2012, (ii) removal of adverse consumer credit information and
information relating to paid up judgements in 2013 and 2014, (iii)
various changes in credit regulation in 2014 and 2015, and (iv)
limitations on fees and interest rates in 2015. Underlying these notices
and regulations is the intention to further financial inclusion. For
instance \citet{roestoff2009} indicates that debt counselling
regulations could assist over-indebted consumers, through the
restructuring of their debt. This directly relates to the affordability
of credit products. 2013 and 2014 regulations relate to government
efforts to remove adverse credit information from credit bureaus to
increase consumer access to credit products.

The second type of development relates to the restructuring of financial
regulation in South Africa. The \citet{fsr2017} announced that the
President had assented to the Financial Sector Regulation Act of 2017.
This regulation set up two authorities: the Prudential Authority, which
sits within the South African Reserve Bank, and the Financial Sector
Conduct Authority (FSCA). Both of these institutions have different
mandates, but consistent across both is to promote financial inclusion
\citep{fsr2017}. Another development is the drafting of a Conduct of
Financial Institutions Bill. This bill proposes to consolidate a number
of the financial sector laws of the country in order to better regulate
the conduct of institutions that provide financial services and
products. According to the bill, the FSCA will provide standards for the
conduct of firms in the provision of financial products and services.
The referred to conduct relates to, inter alia, firms' charging
structures, pricing methodologies, financial product features and the
identification of appropriate and inappropriate target markets.
According to the \citet{cofi2018b}, this enhanced regulation will
further financial inclusion, as improved regulation of firm conduct
provides consumers with greater security, which is required for greater
usage of financial sector products.

The final development we consider is the drafting of a national policy
framework for financial inclusion. According to the \citet{nt2020}, the
existing state of financial inclusion is reported to be high in South
Africa, but the usage of financial products by low income earners is
low. Small, medium and micro enterprises are also reported to receive
minimal services by financial institutions. The \citet{nt2020} proposes
a number of initiatives that relate to increased usage of credit
products by individuals and businesses with less access.

\section{Data and Methodology}\label{data-and-methodology}

Our dataset is collected from various sources. The primary data of
interest are bank lending volumes and rates. This is supplemented by
bank and market related variables that serve as controls in our
analysis. Below, we describe how we measure bank lending volumes and
rates in those segments. We also describe the bank and market specific
controls we use in our analysis.

Across all the bank specific data collected, we restrict our focus to
four banks: Absa, FNB, Standard Bank and Nedbank. We focus on these
banks as they account for the bulk of the banking assets in the
industry. In addition, these banks contain continuous bank lending and
rates data, enabling our panel data analysis.

We also capture bank responses in the following customer segments: (i)
non-financial corporate unsecured lending, (ii) household unsecured
lending, (iii) total unsecured lending, (iv) commercial mortgages to
corporates and households, (v) residential mortgates to households, (vi)
total mortgage lending, (vii) leasing and instalment sales to
corporates, (viii) leasing and instalment sales to households, and (ix)
total leasing and instalment sales. The disaggregation allows us to
measure important differences in bank responses in their different
customer segments. This approach is consistent with \citet{sibande2024}.

\subsection{Bank lending data}\label{bank-lending-data}

Bank lending data are obtained from various banks' monthly disclosures
to the Registrar of the SARB on bank assets and liabilities (``BA900
data'' hereafter). This data is available publicly and is reported in
the form prescribed by a ``BA900'' form available from the Banks
Act.\footnote{See:
  https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis\_document/201605/40002gen297.pdf}

We aggregate all bank assets that are relevant to the customer segments
referred to above. For instance, a bank's unsecured household lending
volumes are estimated as the sum of that bank's household credit card
and overdraft debt, as well as other household loans and advances.
Further detail on the individual bank assets that comprise our various
customer segments are available in Appendix A.2.

\subsection{Bank lending rates data}\label{bank-lending-rates-data}

We pair our bank lending volumes data with corresponding bank lending
rates data. This data is sourced from what is referred to as BA930 data.
Similar to bank reported asset and liability data, banks are required to
report their lending rates to the SARB. This data is provided in a form
prescribed by a ``BA930 form'' available from the Banks Act and is not
publicly available. The BA930 data contains average rates that are
weighted by the outstanding amounts due to the bank at the time of
reporting, for various customer segments. We describe further the
customer segments for which rates data is reported in Appendix A.3.

We use the BA930 data to estimate weighted average rates that are
consistent with the customer segments we use in our analysis. The
formula below shows how we estimate weighted average rates for our 9
customer segments. \(CS_j\) refers to the total number of banking assets
pulled from the BA900 data to form customer segment \(j\) , where
\(j\in[1,9]\). \(w^{j}_{b,i}\) is the weight for each bank's asset \(i\)
in customer segment \(j\) for bank \(b\). It is calculated as the value
of that bank's asset value divided by the total value of the bank's
assets in that customer segment \(j\).

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-rate}{
Rate_{b,j} = \sum_{i=1}^{CS_j}w^{j}_{b,i}P_{b,i}
}\end{equation}

\subsection{Methodology}\label{methodology}

We use a panel data approach to estimate the impact of the different
regulatory developments on bank rates and three month changes in bank
lending volumes. The three month change in lending is calculated as the
log difference in lending at \(t\) and \(t-3\).\footnote{We perform a
  visual test of the correlations between the response variables and our
  narrative indices. These are provided in
  Figure~\ref{fig-macro_narrative_indexes_three_month} and
  Figure~\ref{fig-comp_narrative_indexes_three_month} in Appendices A.7
  and A.9. We find a stronger co-movement between the narrative
  indicators and three month change in lending. This is because the
  three month growth rates are less volatile than than the one month
  changes.} This approach is consistent with \cite{aiyar2016does},
\cite{deli2017real}, \cite{fang2022bank} and
\cite{mirzaei2022effectiveness}, who also consider the effect of
macroprudential reforms on the stock of lending.

\begin{equation}
Rate_{b,t}^{c} = \alpha_1Index_t^i + \tau_b^c + \lambda_t^c + \alpha'\Omega^c + \epsilon_{b,t}^c
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Lending_{b,t}^{c} = \beta_1Index_t^i + \tau_b^c + \lambda_t^c + \beta'\Omega^c + \epsilon_{b,t}^c
\end{equation}

Where \(b\) \(\in [FNB, Absa, Nedbank, Standard Bank]\); \(t\) is the
time period; \(c\) is the credit category; and \(i\) \(\in\)
\([Draft_t, Implementation_t, FinReg_t]\). Therefore \(Lending_{b,t}^c\)
is the bank level three month growth in lending, and \(Rate_{b,t}^c\) is
the bank level lending rate. \(\Omega^c\) is a matrix of controls, which
includes a covid dummy, bank level variables, and other macroeconomic
variables. \(\tau_b^c\) captures the bank fixed effect, \(\lambda_t^c\)
are the monthly time fixed effects, and \(\epsilon_{b,t}^c\) are the
error terms.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Responses to regulation}\label{responses-to-regulation}

Tables 2 and 4 report the results from the estimation of equation (1)
with standard errors clustered at bank level. Tables 3 and 5 relate to
equation (2), where the dependent variable is the log difference in
lending volumes between \(t\) and \(t-3\), also clustered at bank
level.\footnote{Results of one month loan volume changes are available upon request.}

With regard to the impact of macroprudential regulation and bank lending
rates, we find that interest rates on unsecured lending rise while those
on secured lending and mortgages fall by under 1\%. The results are
consistent and significant, when we consider the effect on households
and corporates. Household unsecured and mortgage rates have a stronger
reaction, relative to corporate rates. Total unsecured lending rates
increase by approximately 2.5\%, while lending rates on secured loans
and mortgages fall half a percentage point. Lending rate increases on
household unsecured loans exceed those in corporate unsecured lending
rates (over 3\% relative to 2\% increase in corporate unsecured lending
rates). On the other hand, secured and mortgage lending rates for
corporates decline more, relative to secured and mortgage lending rates
on households.

With regard to the impact of macroprudential regulation and bank lending
growth, we find that the draft indicator is associated with a 2\%
increase in secured lending and less than a 1\% decline in mortgage
lending. The signs of the coefficients are consistent and significant
for both unsecured lending to corporates and households, as well as
mortgage lending to corporates and households. However, lending to
households has a stronger reaction, relative to lending to corporates.
On the contrary, we find that following regulatory implementation, total
unsecured lending falls by approximately 2\%, while the effect on total
secured lending is insignificant. The results are consistent for
unsecured lending to corporates and households (although the coefficient
on unsecured household lending is insignificant).

For both lending rates and volumes, we find that banks response is
larger (and statistically significant) following macroprudential
regulatory implementation, relative to responses to the draft indicator.
The results hold when we include controls, as shown in Tables A4 and A5.

Table 4 provides the relationship between lending rates and financial
regulations seeking to enhance inclusion. For both corporates and
households, we estimate that inclusion related regulations are
associated with respective decreases in secured lending rates of 0.3\%
and 0.2\%. With the inclusion of controls, we record decreases in
corporate lending rates of 0.1\% and lose the statistical significance
in household lending rates in the secured segment (Table A6).
Statistically significant increases in corporate and household lending
rates, respectively of 1\% and 1.5\% in the face inclusion focused
regulation. With controls, the 0.9\% increase in the unsecured lending
rates to households is the only statistically significant result across
customer types.

In Table 5 we focus on lending volumes. Results indicate that financial
regulations are associated with 1.2\% increase in lending volume growth
to corporates in the secured segment. With the inclusion of controls
(Table A7), this result lowers to 0.8\%, and there is a statistically
significant decrease in lending volume growth to households in the
unsecured segment of 0.5\%.

\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion}

\subsubsection{Macroprudential regulatory
changes}\label{macroprudential-regulatory-changes}

The analysis in the paper adds to the existing work examining the
consequences of macroprudential regulation in emerging markets, similar
to \cite{sibande2024} and \cite{makrelov2024lending}. Our results
however, are not directly comparable to other studies. Firstly, we
consider both the effects of anticipated regulatory changes captured by
the pre-announcement of the regulation and the eventual implementation
of the regulation. Secondly, we consider the effect of pre-announced
regulations on loan growth and interest rates on lending, for secured,
unsecured and mortgage loans.

Two possibilities exist for the examination of credit supply growth
following stringent regulatory reforms (positive coefficients on lending
volumes). One is the notion of anticipation effects, where banks use
information on the proposed regulation and dates which they will be
implemented. As such, they can adjust credit supply upwards following
pre-announcement and take advantage of less stringent requirements,
before tighter requirements are introduced.

Another possibility is the occurrence of portfolio re-balancing, where
banks reduce their relatively riskier loans, through a reduction in
unsecured lending. Doing so rebalances their portfolios towards more
prudent ones, such as secured lending \citep{deli2017real}, due to the
fact that macroprudential reforms attach greater risk weights to certain
loan portfolios, such as unsecured credit. For instance, banks in
Denmark retrenched more of their lending portfolio with higher risk
weights, in response to higher capital requirements
\citep{imbierowicz2018time}. Similarly, \cite{cappelletti2019impact}
find that banks classified as Other Systematically-Important (O-SII),
who face added capital requirements, reduce credit to households and
financial sectors and shifted their lending to less risky counterparts
within the non-financial corporations sector. The four banks in our
sample are also classified as Systematically-Important (SI) banks,
facing added capital requirements.

The portfolio re-balancing argument is stronger, when we consider
implementation effects, particularly on lending rates. We observe a
decline in secured lending rates and an increase in unsecured lending
rates as greater risk weights are attached to unsecured credit. This is
also highlighted by the fact that, while corporate unsecured lending
volume increase following implementation, there is no effect on
household lending. As such, household (unsecured) lending appears to
have greater risk weights because the effect on the respective lending
rate is more than the effect on corporate unsecured lending
rate\footnote{The average and maximum lending rate on household unsecured lending far exceed that on corporate unsecured lending, as shown in Table 1}.

Results around regulatory implementation, especially for unsecured
lending, show that, despite tighter macroprudential reforms, we still
observe an increase in unsecured lending, driven by corporate unsecured
lending. This suggest that, despite the implementation of stringent
regulatory measures, banks still lend to higher quality clients within
the unsecured lending space (seemingly corporates) and still charge
relatively higher rates on these loans. Consistent with the portfolio
re-balancing argument, this is not the case for any lending towards
households, even though the implementation effect on lending rates is
more pronounced on household unsecured lending, relative to the
corporate unsecured lending rate.

Results from Table 2 point to similar evidence, when we consider the
draft indicator, where we find an increase in secured lending, relative
to unsecured lending (rightward shift in the secured loan supply curve).
Consequently, the rates associated with unsecured lending fall. These
effects are stronger for household unsecured lending, relative to
corporate secured lending. Furthermore, we find evidence of an increase
in household unsecured lending during the pre-announcement stages, while
this is not the case for corporates. Possibly, this points to banks
taking advantage of less stringent requirements on household unsecured
lending, with both an increase in the supply of loans and interest rates
on these loans before implementation of stringent requirements.
\cite{bridges2014impact} on the other hand, find that an increase in
capital requirements reduces on average, loan growth for commercial real
estate (mortgages), other corporate and household secured lending, while
the response of unsecured lending is relatively weak.

Our results show that mortgage lending decline in all specifications. At
the same time, interest rates on mortgages also decline in all
specifications. Our results suggest that banks tightened downpayment
requirements on mortgages following regulatory reforms, which reduces
the risk associated with mortgage lending. The downside, however, to
tighter deposit requirements on mortgages is that access to mortgage
credit is tightened, hence the decline in mortgage lending volumes for
all specifications in Table 2. Similarly, with banks facing credit
constraints due to the reforms, high-quality mortgage borrowers benefit
from stringent reforms in the form of reduced interest rates on
mortgages. Furthermore, the reduction in mortgage lending rates, in
addition to a reduction in lending volumes, could possibly arise from a
reduction in the demand for mortgage finance. For instance, data from
the National Accounts show that mortgages accounted for 61\% of
household liabilities, but has since declined to only 47\% in
2020\footnote{This evidence is also contained in a report by the Actuarial Society of South Africa, available at: https://www.actuarialsociety.org.za/convention/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2022-ASSA-AnthonyrajahMalwandla.pdf}.
However, they also find that mortgage lending margins increase post
2008, which is more consistent with supply shortfalls than demand
deficits in the mortgage lending market.

A report by the Actuarial Society of South Africa highlights that banks
have reduced their relative exposures to mortgages and have in turn,
increased their exposures to loan classes that are for consumption
purposes. It also highlights that the introduction of the Net Stable
Funding Ratio (NSFR), which forms part of Basel III, potentially implies
higher funding costs on retail mortgages, relative to unsecured retail
loans. In turn, these costs can be shifted to consumers through higher
mortgages lending rates (which does not show up in our results) and/or
rationing of mortgage lending for a given level of lending rate.

Results from Table 2 and 3 show that implementation effects are stronger
relative to announcement effects as captured by the \(Draft\) indicator.
This is specific to unsecured lending rates and volumes. The stronger
implementation effects potentially reflect the endogenous reaction of
banks to pre-announced regulatory actions, thereby influencing
(overestimating) the effects of regulatory implementation. For instance,
\cite{fernandez2023transmission} and \cite{fang2022bank} control for
possible anticipation effects by distinguishing between macroprudential
policies with and without implementation lags as they can have different
effects on macroeconomic variables. As such
\cite{fernandez2023transmission} use only announcement dates to identify
the effects of macroprudential policies. Secondly, they identify
macroprudential policies that have no implementation lags, which are
captured by the announcement date and in the spirit of
\cite{mertens2012empirical}, they also identify macroprudential policies
with implementation lags, which are defined as policies with significant
delay between the announcement and enforcement or implementation date of
at least 90 days. Those with implementation lags could potentially
influence the response of banks as it allows them significant time to
endogenously react to the prudential regulations ahead of
implementation.

Therefore, a further challenge to explore in this research and with the
construction of our macroprudential narrative indices, is disentangling
and distinguishing polices with and without implementation lags. Similar
challenges arise constructing leads and lags for our macroprudential
narrative series to identify any lag effects and identify if banks
adjust their lending before actual implementation dates, as with
\cite{fang2022bank}.

Despite the challenges, the construction of our narrative
macroprudential indices and the use of data on bank lending rates,
contributes significantly to the growing empirical work analysing the
effects of macroprudential policy in South Africa and emerging markets
at large.

\subsubsection{Finance regulatory
changes}\label{finance-regulatory-changes}

After accounting for possible confounders, the results pertaining to
inclusion-focused financial sector reforms indicate that these
regulatory developments are associated with increases in unsecured
lending rates for households, as well as decreased secured lending rates
for corporates. With respect to lending volume growth, inclusion-focused
financial sector developments are associated with decreased growth in
unsecured lending to households and increased growth in secured lending
to corporates.

A number of the regulatory developments were motivated by government
intentions to improve access and lower the costs of financing for
individuals and entities with poorer access. These developments included
removal of adverse information kept at credit bureaus, reducing the
periods that adverse information is kept by those credit bureaus and
providing guidance facilitating debt restructing in cases of risky
and/or reckless lending. According to the \citet{ncrnd}, some of these
developments were to enable greater consumer access to affordable
credit, as well as employment opportunities. The \citet{sagov2013}
express further that negative credit information hinders access by
individuals, who have paid their debts, from accessing affordable
credit. The \citet{sagov2013}, thereafter, took a decision to remove
adverse credit information relating to individuals who have paid their
debts. However, our results suggest the opposite of the intended
effects. Our results indicate that, on average, South African households
paid higher interest rates on their unsecured credit following these
regulatory developments. This was also followed by a decrease in the
growth of unsecured lending volumes to households, which negatively
impacts financial inclusion as greater access to and usage of affordable
credit is impeded.

This result is likely driven by the increase in the informational
asymmetry that the regulations introduce. Banks are financial
intermediaries that collect deposits and issue out loans. To extend
loans, banks face default risk
\citep[\citet{freixas1997}]{bikker142017}. To lessen this risk, banks
rely on information about individuals and firms that can be sourced from
credit bureaus or other institutions \citep{freixas1997}. The regulatory
developments we consider in this paper have the effect of limiting the
amount of information available to banks or the periods that information
could be kept.

Another potential explanation for the decreases in the reduced lending
volume growth and higher interest rates in unsecured lending to
households is the adjustment in the maximum interest rates that are
specified in the NCA regulations. In 2015, the Minister of Trade and
Industry proposed changes to the maximum interest rates and initiation
fees that credit providers could charge consumers
\citep{regulations2015b}. Final changes came into effect that same year
\citep{regulations2015c}. For 5 of the 7 credit types, the net effect of
these adjustments were that maximum interest rates on credit facilities
would be lower by 2.9 percentage points and 7.9 percentage points for
unsecured credit (based on the prevailing repo rate). The maximum rates
set for other credit types increased marginally by 0.1 percentage points
or had no change at all. Initiation and service fees were increased
above the limits set in the 2006 regulations. \citet{yoshino2016}
indicate that this type of rate regulation can restrict credit supply.
Indications are that flexible interest rate setting could further
financial inclusion, as opposed to consumer protection regulation that
seeks to constrain rate determination \citep{barua2016}.

Our secured lending category refers to all loans provided by banks with
an underlying asset offered by the customer as collateral. With
collateral referring to an asset that a bank would be able to seize
should a borrower face bankruptcy which mitigates default risk
\citep{freixas1997}. Following the regulatory developments, we note that
unsecured lending volume growth to households decreased, while secured
lending volume growth to corporates increased. This development likely
reflects bank shift towards safer credit categories. Since the
regulations we consider primarily affect secured and unsecured lending
to households, it appears that banks do not shift from unsecured to
secured lending within households Instead, they appear to be directing
credit supply towards another credit customer type - corporates.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

This study examines the impact of regulation on the bank lending rates
and volumes of the South Africa's largest banks. The regulations we
consider are macroprudential regulations that intend to achieve
stability in the finance sector, as well as financial regulations that
are intended to achieve greater inclusion. These two regulations are
potentially in conflict: one may limit credit supply to achieve
stability, while the other may increase risk through greater credit
extension. We capture these regulatory developments through narrative
indices that comprehensively measure all regulatory developments
relevant to our study.

The effects of these regulations on bank pricing and lending are
estimated through panel models separated by the different types of
regulations we consider. We find that macroprudential regulation results
in increases in interest rates on unsecured lending, while those on
secured lending and mortgages decrease. Further to this, our results
indicate that macroprudential regulations are associated with positive
growth in lending volumes in unsecured and secured credit, while
mortgage lending growth rates decrease. Our estimates of
inclusion-focused initiatives indicate that these developments are
associated with increased bank lending rates for unsecured credit and
decreased growth in the unsecured lending volumes to households. We also
observe increases in the growth of secured lending to corporates and a
decrease in secured lending rates paid by those corporates.

The impact of these two notionally contradictory policies are consistent
with respect to secured lending volume growth and rates to corporates,
as well as the unsecured lending rates paid by households. The opposite
effect is observed with respect to unsecured lending volumes to
households - inclusion efforts lowers usage, whereas macroprudential
efforts increase usage.

Overall, our results indicate that macroprudential policy is working as
intended to achieve financial sector stability. However,
inclusion-focused regulation may be at odds with its own stated
objectives of increasing the extension of affordable credit.

\subsection{Bank lending rates weighting
scheme}\label{bank-lending-rates-weighting-scheme}

The loans quantities from the BA900s are then linked to the lending rate
data from the BA930s using table to create nine lending rate categories
the schema on Table~\ref{tbl-scheme_1}. The weights for each category
are then calculated by dividing the total value of the loans in each
category by the total value of all loans in the BA900s. The weights are
then used to calculate the weighted average lending rate for each month.
The weighted average lending rate is calculated by multiplying the
lending rate for each category by the weight for that category and then
summing the results.

\textcolor{blue}{Announcement, draft and passing of regulation}

\begin{quote}SARB issues  \textbf{directive 1/2009 (1 of 2009)} announcing the approach banks should follow in the application of capital floors. "Modelled capital should not be below 80\% of the capital requirements under Basel I to ensure capital levels do not fall below prudent level". Following Basel II, banks are allowed to use internal models to determine risk weights and in turn, determine capital levels. However, capital floors ensure capital requirements did not fall below a certain percentage of banks’ capital requirements under the previous Basel I framework\citep{basel06}. This in essence, imply greater risk weight attached to riskier credit products. For instance,  \cite{imbierowicz2018time} show that Danish banks reducing their lending on loans with higher risk weights, in response to higher capital requirements, including approaches to capital floors.

\subsubsection{Finance regulation index}\label{finance-regulation-index}

\textbf{Changes in the National Credit Act of 2005 Regulations}

The National Credit Act of 2005 is legislation that was enacted in order
to better regulate the markets for customer credit. According to this
Act its purpose is to develop, inter alia, credit markets that are
accessible by all South Africans, correct the imbalance in negotiating
power between consumers and credit providers, regulate the collection
and sharing of consumer credit information and prevent
over-indebtedness. These, and other, efforts are to achieve a
\emph{``fair, transparent, competitive, sustainable, responsible,
efficient, effective and accessible credit market and industry, and to
protect consumers}\footnote{Section 3 of the NCA.}. The Act specifically
provided the Minister of, the erstwhile, Trade and Industry with powers
to provide regulations pertaining to the implementation of the
Act.\footnote{Section 171 of the NCA.} These regulations were made
available in May 2006.

The initial regulations pre-date the period assessed by this paper, but
the proposed and later realised changes to these Regulations occurred
between 2012 and 2015. It is these developments that are captured within
\(FinReg\).

\emph{2012 Debt Counselling Regulations}

On the 10th of May 2012 the Minister of Trade and Industry published
debt counselling regulations. These codified the process to be followed
by debt counselors and consumers when seeking various order from the
Magistrate's Court. These orders relate to the re-structuring of debt
following a debt counselor's findings of consumer over-indebtedness,
consumer difficulty to meet debt obligations and direct applications by
consumers to the court following an adverse finding by debt counsellors.
The regulations also provided that credit providers were expected to
implement orders from the Court within 10 working days following their
receipt of the court orders from the debt counselors and/or consumers
\citep{regulations2012}.\footnote{The initial draft regulations were
  published on the 15th of May 2009 and did not prescribe the period
  within which court orders, made following debt counselling processes,
  were to be implemented by credit providers}.

\citet{roestoff2009} indicates that provisions of the National Credit
Act in regard to debt relief are to assist over-indebted consumers,
prioritising their interests more than those of credit providers. To
achieve these outcomes, debt review negotiations require that credit
providers have greater responsibility toward the possible negative
outcomes of credit provision.

\emph{2013 and 2014 draft and final credit regulations on the removal of
adverse consumer credit information and information relating to paid up
judgements}

In 2013 the Minister of Trade and Industry issued a notice about a
proposal to remove adverse credit information from credit bureaus. This
followed Cabinet endorsement of a \emph{Removal of Adverse Credit
Information Project}. The Minister proposed that all adverse findings
were to be removed regardless of non-payment. Thereafter on an ongoing
basis adverse information held by credit bureaus were on settled debt or
paid up judgements were to be removed. Communication from the SA
government indicated that this move was to ensure that those who could
access credit, and were prevented from doing so, due to adverse credit
information could do so \citep{sagov2013}.

On the 26th of February 2014, the Minister published final regulations
instructing credit bureaus that adverse credit information was to be
removed on all paid up judgements \citep{regulations2014a}. The final
regulations were less ambitious than the proposal. Nevertheless, the
\citet{ncrnd} indicates that the regulations were to enable consumer
access to affordable credit, as well as employment opportunities.

\emph{2014 and 2015 changes to the National Credit Regulations}

On the 1st of August 2014, the Minister of Trade and Industry published
draft national credit regulations that proposed a host of changes to the
existing 2006 regulations, as amended \citep{regulations2014b}. Many of
these were proposed insertions into the regulations that did not exist
before. The proposals included a criteria to be adopted by credit
providers to conduct affordability assessments to further limit
instances of reckless lending. Credit providers were provided with
additional limits on when adverse consumer credit information was to be
shared with credit bureaus; for instance, information that consumers did
not meet their financial obligations would not be shared unless a
consumer would have missed their minimum obligations for three
consecutive months. Related to credit bureau information were changes to
the maximum periods that credit information were to be kept by credit
bureaus. For many of the types of information kept, the proposed
regulations proposed reduced retention periods. For instance,
information relating to enquiries on a consumers record was to be
reduced from 2 years to 2 months; information on liquidations had been
kept for an unlimited period and the proposal was to reduce this to 5
years; information on complaints initiated by customers was kept from 18
months and proposed to be reduced to 6 months. Other changes included
explicit references to the registration and operation of payment
distribution agents, as well as the provision of clarity on when credit
information could be obtained for employment purposes.

By the 13th of March 2015, the Minister provided a final set of proposed
changes and insertions into the regulations that would come into effect
\citep{regulations2015a}. Many of the 2014 proposals were accepted, some
with changes. Some of these included the explicit criteria for
affordability assessments, changes to the retention periods for credit
bureau information, and the additional limits on when adverse consumer
credit information was to be shared with credit bureaus.

\emph{2015 draft and final credit regulations on limitations on fees and
interest rates}

Section 42(1) of the 2006 credit regulations provided the maximum
interest rates to be set on different types of credit
\citep{regulations2006}. These included mortgages, credit facilities,
unsecured credit, developmental credit, short term credit, other and
incidental credit agreements. Incidental and short term credit rates
were respectively capped at 2\% and 5\% per month. The limits for other
rates were calculated at the repo rate scaled up by 2.2 and increased by
fixed interest rates ranging between 5 to 20 percentage points depending
on the credit type. In addition, the regulations also provided the
maximum Rand values that would be set as initiation and service fees.
The initiation fees varied by credit type.

In 2015, the Minister of Trade and Industry proposed changes to these
interest rates and initiation fees \citep{regulations2015b}. Final
changes came into effects that same year \citep{regulations2015c}. For 5
of the 7 credit types, the Minister provided a lower scalar by higher
interest rate premium. The net effect of this adjustment was that
maximum interest rates on credit facilities would be lower by 2.9
percentage points and 7.9 percentage points for unsecured credit (based
on the prevailing repo rate). The maximum rates set for other credit
types increased marginally by 0.1 percentage points of had no change at
all. Initiation and service fees were increased above the limits set in
the 2006 regulations.

\textbf{Restructuring of the financial sector regulation}

\emph{Financial Sector Regulation Act}

The Financial Sector Regulation Act of 2017 represented a structural
shift in the regulation of financial institutions in South Africa, as it
set up a framework for financial regulation and supervision.

The Act importantly sets up two authorities with important regulatory
powers. One is the Prudential Authority, which sits within the South
African Reserve Bank. This object of this authority is to ensure the
soundness of financial institutions and infrastructure and financial
stability, as well as protecting consumers against risks from financial
institutions. The other authority created by the act is the Financial
Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA).\footnote{The FSCA replaced the
  Financial Services Board. See:
  https://www.fsca.co.za/TPNL/4/fsb4/proactive.html} The object of the
FSCA was to protect financial consumers by promoting fair treatment and
financial education, as well as to maintaining financial stability and
market efficiency.

Both the PA and the FSCA were tasked with promoting financial inclusion.
Which the Act defined as a state where all persons have access to
\emph{``timely and fair access to appropriate, fair and affordable
financial products and services''} \citep{fsr2017}.

\emph{Draft and Update of the Conduct of Financial Institutions Bill}

In 2018 the National Treasury presented a draft Conduct of Financial
Institutions (COFI) Bill. This bill proposes consolidating a number of
the financial sector laws of the country. At present, the nature of
financial sector regulation is focused on particular sectors. For
instance, insurance companies are regulated by the Insurance Act,
investment schemes by the Collective Investment Schemes Control Act and
financial service providers by the Financial Advisory and Intermediary
Services Act. The proposed bill seeks to provide the provide the
Financial Services Conduct Authority with the ability to regulate the
conduct of institution that provide the similar services and products
\citep{cofi2018a}.

With regard to credit provision, the COFI bill proposes providing the
FSCA with the ability to provide standards for the conduct of firms in
the provision of financial products and services. The referred to
conduct relates to, inter alia, firms' charging structures, pricing
methodologies, financial product features and the identification of
appropriate and inappropriate target markets
\citep[\citet{cofi2020}]{cofi2018a}. The \citet{cofi2018b} explains that
this proposed legislation is premised on supporting greater financial
inclusion as the better regulation of firm conduct would provide
consumers with greater security required for their usage of financial
sector products. A draft COFI bill was presented in 2018 and an updated
draft in 2020 \citep{cofi2020}.

\textbf{National financial inclusion policy}

\emph{Draft Financial Inclusion Policy Report is published}

In 2020 the National Treasury provided a draft national policy framework
for financial inclusion in South Africa. The existing state of financial
inclusion is reported to be high in South Africa but the National
Treasury notes that the usage of financial products by low income
earners remains low and that small, medium and micro enterprises are
only marginally serviced \citep{nt2020}. On the back of these
challenges, the draft national policy framework provides the initiatives
to be support the three key pillars they identify as being important to
financial inclusion: (i) deepening financial inclusion, (ii) improving
access for SMMEs and (iii) supporting more diverse providers of
financial services.

A number of initiatives identified by the \citet{nt2020} in the above
mentioned three pillars relate directly to credit currently extended by
incumbent banks. To increase developmental loans provided to low income
families, the policy proposes governments sharing losses on defaults and
a students future income to assess affordability of loans, as well as
the use of different forms of collateral (such as a permission to
occupy) to secure mortgage financing. SMME access to financing is
planned to be supported by improvements in credit infrastructure for
small businesses; an example of this will include consideration of SMME
payments data as information relevant to determining ability to access
credit. To support more providers of financial services \citet{nt2020}
proposes promoting the development of cooperative banks to compete
against incumbent banks, developing a licensing framework that supports
the entry of new financial institutions and assessing the role of a
state owned bank.

The financial inclusion policy sets out a number of initiatives that are
likely to have an impact when and how incumbent banks extend credit. In
addition, the proposed framework as suggests various programmes that
would create additional financial institutions that are likely to
compete with incumbents in markets relating to credit provision.
